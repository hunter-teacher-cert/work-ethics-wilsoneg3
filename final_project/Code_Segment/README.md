## AI Melody Generator

Our code seeks to allow a human to provide creative input and intervention to the output generated by an AI model, thereby meeting the criteria of Compendium of US Copyright Office Practices 313.2

- User creates an 8 note melodic pattern (Creative input)
- Pattern is given to AI model which extends this melodic pattern.
- User has ability to modify extended melodic pattern (Intervention)

### Tools used in our code:

- Magenta.js - RNN model (Recurrent Neural Network)
Used for AI melodic generation
- p5.js - Used for GUI and Visualization of melodic patterns
- Tone.js - Used for sonification of User and AI generated Musical output
