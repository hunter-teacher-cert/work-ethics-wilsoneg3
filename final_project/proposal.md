### Ethics Final Project Proposal

#### Topic: AI Authorship and Copyright



**Group Members:**
- Liam Baum
- Ian Scheffler
- Eric Wilson


**Issue we are going to tackle:**<br>
Stand alone generative works by AI do not meet current copyright criteria to be afforded protection under copyright law:<br>
*Compendium of US Copyright Office Practices 313.2 (3rd ed. 2017):<br>
The Office of Copyrights will not register works produced by a machine or mechanical process that operates randomly or automatically without sufficient creative input or intervention from a human author in the resulting work.*

Given that Generative AI work requires training data to teach itself how to create these works, it could be considered derivative.

**How you will provide a program as part of the project:**<br>
 Create a basic GUI interface which allows a human to provide creative input or intervention to a generative Machine Learning model so that the resulting output could qualify for copyright protection.

This project would be implemented in using Javascript libraries. It would use p5.js for the GUI and [Magenta.js](https://github.com/magenta/magenta-js/tree/master/music#spice) for the Machine Learning portion.


**Additional considerations on this topic:**<br>
Training data used for generative models may be protected by copyright and therefore the use of them to train models which then produce "new" output based on this training data could be considered unethical and the resulting output could possibly in violation of copyright law.<br>
A possible solution to this would be to train ML models using works within the public domain.
