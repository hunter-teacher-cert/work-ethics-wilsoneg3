# Facebook Oculus vs Valve Index
## Oculus TOS

You give them permission to use all your information in ads
If you get kicked off fb, you can lose your ability to use the Oculus as well - that’s a big $ hit
You must continually comply with updates to Oculus TOS or else lose ability to use your Oculus
5.1- no guarantees that it is safe. If you smash something in your house while using the VR, it is your fault.
Side note: what prompts lawyers to transition from lower to ALL UPPERCASE?
6- dispute resolution Class action lawsuits are denied
They yell that you waive your right to arbitration.  You can opt out of that by sending your name, address, and FB email via snail mail to an address in Cali.
Large swaths of the TOS ( 2.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11) remain in place even if you terminate your relationship w Oculus
They say “for the avoidance of doubt” a lot
Oculus collects info on your biometrics, including hand size and movements.

## Valve Index TOS

Collects biometric data
Can sell anonymous data to 3rd parties (aggregated or not)
Users can access, export and delete their data associated with their Steam ID
Do not have to use your real name or ID to create an account
No guarantee of safety- if you smash yourself or your device into your TV it is your fault
Overall less pleasant to read (tiny black and white font)

# Analysis-  
## Oculus- 
It was hard to get to the bottom of exactly what Oculus or Valve doing and collecting most of the time just from reading it myself.  There are separate TOS for regular Oculus users and those who have paid $300 extra for the dubious privilege of not signing up with their FB account (something they promised they wouldn’t do and then did anyways #surprisedpikachu).  They are also sunsetting the option to use an Oculus without a FB account in 2023.  Some light Googling revealed that there was lots of coverage of Oculus’ introductory TOS but that has diminished in last few years.  The earlier articles highlighted Oculus’ pledge to not collect or sell biometric data or information about room dimensions; a pledge which has since been broken.  Overall, it seems that Facebook is actively trying to roll Oculus’ TOS into the overall FB TOS, which are extremely invasive.  By combining biometric and house data with other info that FB pulls such as who you talk to, where you go, and what you say, they seem to be at the forefront of collecting and analyzing data at the junction of mind and body.

## Valve index- 
The major difference between Valve and Oculus is that Valve and Steam create room for the appearance of anonymity by allowing you to use any name or identity you wish.  This appearance of anonymity may be an illusion because they can combine information such as your CC number, device ID number, address, etc to identify you.  Perhaps it is because I am a longtime Steam fan, but I would be more inclined to roll with Valve Index over the Oculus, even though I have used an Oculus and absolutely loved it.

### Side note: 
Valve Index is also a popular website that sells… valves!  Learned a lot about trunnion ball, floating ball, and gate valves.  The more you know.
