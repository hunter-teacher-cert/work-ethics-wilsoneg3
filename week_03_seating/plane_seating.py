# This is a collab between Eric Wilson and Ian Scheffler
# Next steps:
# Generalize the code added to seat_economy to work for any nxn size plane
# Fix the bug where if a block of seat is NOT found in the requested size, everyone still gets seated
# Figure out why some available seats are not assigned when the economy class is seated
