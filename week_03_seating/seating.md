My extremely rough seating algorithm would strive to seat people from the back first.  I would then want to sit people from window seats first and then to the aisle- so the people at the back windows of the plane would board first, followed by middle back, aisle back, and so on.  In terms of ability to choose seats, I would divide families into units of 2 or 3 if possible.  Accordingly, a family of 5 would be divided into units of 2 and 3.  A family of 4 would be divided into 2 and 2.  A family of 10 would be divided into 3, 3, 2, and 2.  This would be more equitable because it would accommodate individuals who arenâ€™t booking flights as a family as well.
