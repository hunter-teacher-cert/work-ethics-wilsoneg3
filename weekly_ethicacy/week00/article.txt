Although the technology announced by Tesla and Elon may be far off, any step towards increased automation makes me concerned for the future employment opportunities of my students.  Many of the most profitable tech solutions appear to be targeted at automating middle class jobs; truck driving is one of the biggest middle class jobs out there and entrepreneurs are salivating at the prospect of eliminating the labor costs associated with it.  With Amazon, Target, and McDonaldâ€™s all but eliminating the need for cashiers, I am concerned about what job opportunities will remain.  

Aside from the economic concerns associated with automation, there is something ominous about the fact that Musk feels the need to state that he is designing the robot with the intent to make it easy for humans to overpower.  After seeing the rapid increases in technology in my lifetime I have long since learned to not dismiss the paranoiac concerns of science fiction.  It seems inevitable at this point that a robot produced by Boston Dynamics or Tesla will inflict some sort of damage on a human life.
